We then use that specific information to make another AJAX call to two endpoints with the iTunes search API. The first identifies the specific album, and then the second to return the specific tracks and their URLs that will take the user to the iTunes webpage. Then using DOM manipulation, all of the results are shown to the user. In addition, the user can save specific tracks, and previously searched albums are also automatically saved.
