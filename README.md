# My second homework!

# Description
For this assignment we were tasked with building a mobile-first responsive portfolio website. Part of the assignment was for us to use the Bootstrap library to create the layout of the website.

# Structure
I started with incorporating the navbar into my website. This portion was fairly straight forward excpect for getting the navbar collapse button to work. I eventually realized that I was missing the the javascript link necessary to get the functionality to work.

I then spent a significant amount of time trying to get the grid system just right.

Finally, once I was satisfied with the overall structure, I grouped relevant pieces of information into cards to make it look more cohesive and make it easier to follow.
